Always carry a reusable cloth or jute bag for shopping. Politely refuse plastic bags at stores to prevent waste in the first place.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REUSE**\nUse them as bin liners for dry waste or for other household needs until they are no longer usable.\n\n‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nOnly clean and dry bags can be placed in dry waste. However, they are low-value and often not recycled, so reduction is a much better goal."}
{"input_text": "PET bottles like soft drink bottles", "output_text": "PET bottles are highly recyclable, but it's even better not to create the waste at all! ü•§\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nCarry a reusable water bottle. Opt for water filters at home instead of buying bottled water.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nThis is a great option as PET is a valuable material. Empty the bottle, crush it, and place it in your dry waste bin.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê **REUSE**\nGood for DIY projects like vertical gardens or bird feeders, but recycling is generally better for turning it back into a useful raw material."}

Here's the most effective plan for them. üç±\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nCarry your own reusable container when ordering takeaway. Many restaurants in Bengaluru are happy to support this.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REUSE**\nWash them thoroughly and use them for storing leftovers, packing lunch, or organizing small items.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nMake sure they are clean and free of food residue. A quick rinse is usually enough. Place the clean, dry container in your dry waste bin."}

Here‚Äôs the 3R strategy, from best to worst. ‚ú®\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nUse reusable containers with lids (like steel dabbas) to store food instead of covering with foil.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nIt is 100% recyclable! Collect used foil, bunch it up into a ball (at least the size of a lemon), and drop it in your dry waste bin.\n\n‚≠ê **REUSE**\nIf the foil is clean, you can wipe it and reuse it once or twice. It can also be used to sharpen scissors."}

Here‚Äôs how to manage them effectively. ü•´\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nSteel and aluminum are valuable and easily recycled. Rinse the can, place the lid inside, and put it in your dry waste or give it to your local 'kabadiwala'.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nBuy fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned ones where possible. Buy in bulk to reduce the number of cans.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê **REUSE**\nAfter cleaning, they make excellent pen holders or small planters."}

The top priority is safe disposal, not recycling or reuse. üíä\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **SAFE DISPOSAL**\nDO NOT flush them or throw them in the regular bin. This is critical. Take them to a pharmacy or a hospital that has a take-back program. This prevents environmental pollution.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nBuy medicines only in the required quantity to avoid them expiring in the first place.\n\n‚≠ê **REUSE**\nNot possible. Never consume expired medicines. This is a health and safety instruction."}

There is only one priority: safety. üíâ\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **SAFE DISPOSAL**\nNEVER dispose of them in household waste. Place them in a hard, puncture-proof container (like a detergent bottle), seal it, and label it 'SHARPS'. Contact a biomedical waste disposal service or your local clinic/hospital for proper collection. Safety is the only goal here."}
{"input_tExt": "Soiled bandages or cotton", "output_text": "Items with bodily fluids are biomedical waste. Safety for sanitation workers is the top priority. ü©π\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **SAFE DISPOSAL**\nThis is not recyclable.

{"input_text": "CFL or LED bulbs", "output_text": "Light bulbs are e-waste. Safe disposal to prevent pollution is the #1 goal. üí°\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE (Safe Disposal)**\nDO NOT throw them in the regular bin, as CFLs contain mercury. They must be taken to a designated e-waste collection point. This is the most responsible action.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nBuy high-quality, long-lasting LED bulbs which are more energy-efficient and last for years, reducing the frequency of disposal."}
{"input_text": "Alkaline batteries (AA, AAA)", "output_text": "Batteries are hazardous waste! Preventing them from ending up in a landfill is the top priority. üîã\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE (Safe Disposal)**\nCollect them separately and take them to a proper collection point. Look for battery collection boxes in supermarkets, electronics stores, or e-waste centers across the city.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nSwitch to rechargeable batteries. This is a very high-impact change that significantly reduces waste over time."}
{"input_text": "Old keyboards or mice", "output_text": "Broken keyboards and mice are classic e-waste. Here's what to do, from best to worst: üñ±Ô∏è\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE (Safe Disposal)**\nThey contain various materials that can be recovered. Take them to an authorized e-waste recycler.

You can put them in your wet waste bin, but it's better to give them to vendors who use them for fuel or to specialized processors."}
{"input_text": "Tea bags and coffee grounds", "output_text": "Your daily chai and coffee can help your garden! Avoiding waste is the first step. ‚òï\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REDUCE**\nUse a reusable tea strainer with loose-leaf tea instead of single-use bags. This completely eliminates the waste.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE (Compost)**\nThis is a fantastic option. Both are great for compost. Tear open plastic-based tea bags and compost only the leaves inside.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê **REUSE**\nUsed tea leaves can soothe puffy eyes. Coffee grounds are a great natural exfoliant."}

Donate them to animal shelters who are always in need of bedding. You can also cut them up to make reusable bags, cushion covers, or cleaning cloths.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nFind a local textile recycler. This is less common and harder to do than simple reuse, so it's a lower priority."}

Giving them a second life is the best route. üëü\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **REUSE**\nIf they are still wearable, wash them and donate them to a local charity. A local cobbler ('mochi') can often repair them cheaply.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê **RECYCLE**\nSome global brands have collection programs in their stores to recycle old shoes, but this is less accessible than direct reuse or repair."}
{"input_text": "Leftover paint cans", "output_text": "Paint is hazardous waste. The top priority is ensuring it doesn't harm the environment. üé®\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **SAFE DISPOSAL**\nContact your local hazardous waste disposal facility.
